# Pulsaris Litepaper

## Introduction
Pulsaris is designed as a resilient, modular token ecosystem that combines staking, governance, and automated vault strategies.  
Our mission is to deliver a secure, scalable, and transparent foundation for decentralized finance.

---

## Vision
- **Security First:** Immutable provenance, reproducible builds, and audit‑ready governance.  
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture for staking, governance, and vault flows.  
- **Automation:** Bot‑assisted vaults for risk management and hedging.  
- **Community Ownership:** DAO‑driven decision making with transparent rules.

---

## Tokenomics
- **Ticker:** $PULSE  
- **Total Supply:** 100% fixed at genesis  
- **Allocations:**  
  - 40% Staking Rewards (see Emissions Curve)  
  - 20% Treasury (DAO‑controlled)  
  - 20% Ecosystem Development  
  - 20% Team & Early Contributors (vesting schedule)

### Emissions Curve
40% of supply is distributed as staking rewards over 8 years.  
Front‑loaded to reward early adopters, tapering to ensure sustainability.

| 1    | 10%        | 10%          |
| 2    | 8%         | 18%          |
| 3    | 6%         | 24%          |

## Governance
- DAO‑based governance with on‑chain proposals and voting  
- Quorum and thresholds defined in `GOVERNANCE.md`  
- Upgrade authority transitions from multi‑sig to DAO after stabilization

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Testnet deployment, emissions validation, explorer visibility  
- **Phase 2:** Mainnet launch, DAO activation, liquidity routing  
- **Phase 3:** Exchange listings, ecosystem integrations, governance expansion

## Closing
Pulsaris is built for resilience, transparency, and community trust.  
By combining reproducible infrastructure with clear governance and sustainable tokenomics, we aim to set a new standard for decentralized finance.
